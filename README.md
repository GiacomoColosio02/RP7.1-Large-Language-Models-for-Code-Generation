## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a flexible, multi-model system for automatic code generation that can work with different programming languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.) and evaluate the generated code using both standard metrics and advanced semantic evaluation techniques. The system aims to:
- Mitigate common issues like outdated training data, hallucinations, and contextual limitations.
- Leverage external knowledge and domain-specific code snippets to improve generation quality.
- Provide a robust evaluation framework that goes beyond simple n-gram matching by integrating logical and semantic assessments.

## Project Structure

### 1. Code Generation using LLM and RAG

#### A) Motivation and Challenges

Despite the impressive performance of modern LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, CodeLlama), there are several challenges that motivate the integration of additional techniques:
- **Outdated Training Data:** LLMs might not include the latest library versions or language features.
- **Hallucinations:** When data is missing, LLMs can generate plausible but incorrect code.
- **Contextual Limitations:** Finite token limits can lead to incomplete or out-of-context responses.
- **Interpretability:** The “black box” nature of LLMs can obscure the reasoning behind code generation.
- **Computational Cost:** High computational requirements can impact deployment efficiency.

#### B) Proposed Solutions

The project explores two complementary approaches inspired by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm:

##### B1: Embedding-based Retrieval

- **Objective:** Enhance the context provided to the LLM by retrieving domain-specific code snippets.
- **Method:**
  - Transform both the user’s prompt and available code fragments into a shared semantic vector space using embedding models.
  - Retrieve the top-K most similar snippets from a vector store.
  - Inject these snippets into the prompt as additional context.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Provides updated and domain-specific data without re-training the LLM.
  - Reduces hallucinations and improves the accuracy of code generation.
- **Implementation Tools:** OpenAI Ada (or similar) for embeddings, FAISS (or comparable vector store) for similarity search, and LangChain for orchestration.

##### B2: Advanced Prompting and Few-Shot Learning

- **Objective:** Guide the LLM to generate high-quality code via enhanced prompt design.
- **Method:**
  - Utilize few-shot learning by providing 2-3 solved examples within the prompt.
  - Include detailed instructions (e.g., “explain your steps” or “break down the solution into logical, commented sections”) to steer the LLM.
  - Experiment with iterative approaches like self-refinement where the model reviews and corrects its own output.
- **Benefits:**
  - Activates in-context learning, leading to more reliable and structured code.
  - Reduces syntactical and logical errors through explicit examples.
- **Implementation Tools:** PromptingGuide.ai for best practices, along with a modular prompt engineering framework to compare different LLMs.

### 2. Code Evaluation

#### A) Standard Functional Metrics

- **Pass@k:** Measures the probability that at least one out of k generated solutions is correct by running unit tests.
- **BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR:** Traditional text-similarity metrics adapted for code, though they might miss semantic correctness.
- **CodeBLEU:** An improved variant that incorporates syntactic and semantic aspects by comparing abstract syntax trees (AST) and data flow.

#### B) Semantic Evaluation with CodeJudge

- **Objective:** Overcome the limitations of text-based metrics by evaluating the semantic and logical correctness of generated code.
- **Method:**
  - Use a dedicated LLM evaluator (e.g., CodeJudge) that performs a step-by-step analysis of the code.
  - Provide binary correctness checks and a detailed assessment of errors (e.g., syntax vs. logical errors).
- **Benefits:**
  - Achieves a higher correlation with human judgment compared to standard metrics.
  - Recognizes partially correct solutions and quantifies the quality of the code beyond mere string matching.
- **Implementation Tools:** Integrate CodeJudge (or similar frameworks) to prompt the LLM with detailed evaluation tasks and compare results with standard metrics.

## Architecture and Libraries

The application is designed with a modular architecture that separates the code generation and evaluation pipelines:

- **Generation Module:**  
  - **Input:** User prompt (optionally enriched with retrieved context).  
  - **Output:** Generated code from one or more LLMs (e.g., CodeLlama, GPT variants).  
  - **Orchestration:** Managed using LangChain for prompt assembly and multi-turn conversations.

- **Retrieval Module:**  
  - Utilizes semantic embeddings to search and retrieve code snippets from a vector database (FAISS, Weaviate, etc.).
  
- **Evaluation Module:**  
  - **Functional Evaluation:** Executes code in sandboxed environments and calculates metrics like Pass@k.
  - **Semantic Evaluation:** Uses CodeJudge to perform in-depth, LLM-based analysis of the generated code.

- **Key Libraries and Tools:**  
  - **LangChain:** For orchestrating LLM interactions and prompt management.  
  - **Embedding Models:** Such as OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 or open-source alternatives.  
  - **Vector Stores:** FAISS for efficient similarity search.  
  - **Testing Frameworks:** For executing code and running unit tests (inspired by benchmarks like HumanEval).  
  - **CodeJudge:** For semantic evaluation based on chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Conclusions and Objectives

The ultimate aim of this project is twofold:

1. **Develop a Multi-Model Code Generation System:**  
   - A system that is flexible enough to integrate various LLMs and retrieval techniques, and that can be extended with future advancements in AI.

2. **Comprehensive Evaluation Framework:**  
   - An in-depth analysis comparing standard metrics with LLM-based evaluators like CodeJudge.
   - Insights into cases where traditional metrics (e.g., BLEU, CodeBLEU) diverge from human judgment and how semantic evaluation can bridge this gap.

This dual approach is expected to highlight the benefits of enriching prompts with domain-specific context and advanced prompting techniques, ultimately leading to more reliable and accurate code generation.
